The police detective may be a manager who coordinates staff in some important investigation, but rarely has the luxury of concentrating on a single case. In the univted States, his responsibilities at any one time may number in the dozens or hundreds of open cases. The detective's crucial function is to marshal enough evidence to allow an arrest, in turn leading to a successful criminal prosecution.

In detective classics, the private eye is hired to handle some ordinary civil or private matter (such as a cheating spouse), and then is drawn into the investigation of a murder or series of murders as the case unfolds. Like any professional, the private eye seperates his personal feelings from the job at hand, and cheerfully works for the guilty and innocent alike, as long as his fee is paid. The private investigator is usually shown to have been a member of a police force in the past, using those connections to his advantage in the present. Usually he is not prosperous and never has known much money, but his private code and keen awareness purify his manners. Depending on state or on local law, police experience may not be necessary.

The notion of \"exile\" has real power in such a setting.
